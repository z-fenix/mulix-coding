# Tasks phase

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** invoke `writing-plans` now and follow it
exactly. Its output is this change's `tasks.md`. This skill only adds
what mulix needs around it.

## Inputs

- `docs/specs/<change>/spec.md` — the requirements authority.
- The approved design: `design_path` from `mulix state show`
  (architectural), or the in-chat design approved in the design phase
  (bounded).
- `.mulix/memory/constitution.md`, if it has real content — every task
  must comply with its MUST principles; an unjustified violation is a
  plan defect, fixed here, not in build.

## Output: `docs/changes/<change>/tasks.md`

Write it exactly as writing-plans specifies — plan header, Global
Constraints, Review Focus, then one section per task — with these
mulix specifics:

- **Header:** `**Spec:**` names `docs/specs/<change>/spec.md`, and
  `**Design:**` the design doc (or "approved in chat" for bounded, with the
  design's approach summarized under Architecture). Keep the "For agentic
  workers" line; the build phase decides which executor runs it.
- **Task headings:** `## Task N: <name>`, N = 1, 2, 3... in execution
  order, no gaps, each exactly once. The build executors extract briefs by
  this heading, and the guards match ledger lines and reports to it.
- **Steps:** the RED → verify RED → GREEN → verify GREEN → commit order
  writing-plans prescribes, with complete test and code blocks and
  `Expected:` lines. The build phase's TDD evidence comes from these
  steps.
- `.mulix/templates/tasks-template.md` shows the resulting layout. If a
  preset overrides it (`mulix preset resolve tasks-template`), follow the
  override's structure — but the `## Task N` headings are not optional.

A small bounded change is still a plan: one or two tasks is fine; the
headings and steps are not.

## Review before the gate

1. Run writing-plans' Self-Review and fix what it finds inline.
2. Dispatch one plan reviewer with
   `.claude/skills/writing-plans/plan-document-reviewer-prompt.md`
   (plan = tasks.md, spec = spec.md). Fix every Issue it raises; its
   Recommendations are advisory.
3. Link tasks.md for the human and ask whether it captures what they
   want. Wait for their answer; revise on feedback.

There is no execution handoff here: don't ask how to execute and don't
invoke an executor. The build phase asks.

## Advancing out of this phase

```
mulix state set tasks_path docs/changes/<change>/tasks.md
mulix state transition tasks-complete
```

The guard checks tasks.md exists inside `docs/changes/<change>/`, is
non-empty, and has `## Task N` sections numbered 1..n.
